# 🍲 Food Recipe App

## 📖 Overview
The Food Recipe App is a React-based application that lets users manage their personal collection of recipes. Users can add new recipes, update existing ones, delete unwanted recipes, and mark favorites. All recipes and user actions are saved locally in the browser using `localStorage`, so your data stays safe between sessions — no backend needed!
